# Beavers-blinkingLEDs
03/02/2020 Blinking LED Project
This project was part of the February 3, 2020 1st Stouffville Beavers Monday Night group activities.

The each kit contained the following components:
Qty 1 Digispark Kickstarter ATTINY85 Arduino General Micro USB Development Board
Qty 1 170 pin breadboard
Qty 5 LEDs (1 of each red, green, yellow, blue, white)
Qty 5 male-male dupont cables
Qty 6 male-female dupont cables
Qty 5 220 Ohm resistors
Qty 1 Fritzing diagram

The Digispark ATTINY85 is a small microcontroller that was pre-programed with code to turn all the LEDs on one by one, and then in reverse, turn them off.

Code is included, along with the Fritzing sketch and JPG/PNG image for display/printing from computers that do not have Fritzing installed.
